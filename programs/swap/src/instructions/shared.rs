/*
This is the function transfer_tokens, which facilitates the transfer of tokens from one account to another. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the parameters:

from: The source token account from which tokens will be transferred.
to: The destination token account where tokens will be received.
amount: The number of tokens to transfer.
mint: The mint address that represents the token being transferred.
authority: The account (usually a wallet) that has the authority to approve the token transfer (e.g., the signer of the transaction).
token_program: The token program on the Solana blockchain that facilitates the transfer and other token operations.
The function returns a Result<()>, which means it will either complete the transaction successfully (return Ok(())) or return an error if something goes wrong.
